    <h1>Vision–Automation Integration</h1>
    <p>
        Industrial vision systems are rarely standalone. In a production line,
        inspection results must be communicated to automation controllers in a
        deterministic and reliable manner.
    </p>

    <!-- ================= PROBLEM ================= -->
    <h2>Automation Context</h2>
    <p>
        In real manufacturing environments, vision systems operate as one part
        of a larger control system. Inspection results must arrive within a
        defined cycle time and trigger downstream actions without ambiguity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Any unstable or non-deterministic behavior can lead to incorrect rejects,
        line stoppages, or quality escapes.
    </p>

    <!-- ================= SYSTEM FLOW ================= -->
    <h2>System-Level Flow</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Part reaches inspection position</li>
        <li>Automation system triggers image capture</li>
        <li>Vision system processes ROI and validates result</li>
        <li>Final OK / NG decision is generated</li>
        <li>Decision signal is sent to automation controller</li>
        <li>Controller executes accept / reject / stop logic</li>
        <li>Result is logged for traceability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The vision system behaves as a deterministic decision module rather than
        an isolated AI component.
    </p>

    <!-- ================= DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS ================= -->
    <h2>Design Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear separation between detection and decision logic</li>
        <li>Single inspection result per cycle</li>
        <li>Fail-safe behavior on uncertain outputs</li>
        <li>Predictable response time</li>
        <li>Simple OK / NG signaling for automation compatibility</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ================= MY ROLE ================= -->
    <h2>My Contribution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed vision outputs assuming real PLC constraints</li>
        <li>Ensured OK / NG signals are unambiguous</li>
        <li>Considered timing and inspection cycle behavior</li>
        <li>Focused on stability over raw algorithm performance</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ================= SIMULATOR LINK ================= -->
    <h2>Inspection Simulator Reference</h2>
    <p>
        The industrial inspection simulator demonstrates how vision outputs,
        inspection states, and logs would appear to an automation controller
        during continuous operation.
