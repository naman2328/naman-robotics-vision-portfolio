    <h1>Industrial Vision Inspection System</h1>
    <p>
        Camera-based OCR and visual inspection system designed for industrial
        environments where reliability, repeatability, and deterministic
        decisions matter more than raw accuracy metrics.
    </p>

    <!-- ================= PROBLEM ================= -->
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
        In manufacturing environments, visual inspection must operate continuously
        under non-ideal conditions such as variable lighting, glare, motion blur,
        and part misalignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Manual inspection is slow and inconsistent, while naive computer-vision
        pipelines often fail due to false positives, unstable OCR results, and
        lack of validation logic. A usable industrial vision system must therefore
        behave like deterministic software, not a one-off demo.
    </p>

    <!-- ================= SYSTEM OVERVIEW ================= -->
    <h2>System Overview</h2>
    <p>The inspection system follows a fixed and predictable pipeline:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Industrial camera captures the frame</li>
        <li>Region of Interest (ROI) is locked to avoid irrelevant areas</li>
        <li>OCR / visual inspection runs only inside the ROI</li>
        <li>Detected output is validated against expected patterns</li>
        <li>Final OK / NG decision is generated</li>
        <li>Inspection result and timestamp are logged</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This flow ensures stable performance and predictable behavior on a
        production line.
    </p>

    <!-- ================= WHAT I BUILT ================= -->
    <h2>What I Built</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed ROI-based inspection to minimize false detections</li>
        <li>Integrated PaddleOCR for text recognition inside constrained regions</li>
        <li>Implemented validation logic instead of trusting raw OCR output</li>
        <li>Built OK / NG decision logic suitable for automation systems</li>
        <li>Added timestamped logging for inspection traceability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The focus was not on maximizing OCR accuracy in isolation, but on building
        a complete inspection pipeline that behaves reliably in real conditions.
    </p>

    <!-- ================= FAILURE FIRST ================= -->
    <h2>What Failed and How It Was Fixed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>OCR instability due to glare:</strong>
            Reduced inspection area to a fixed ROI and avoided reflective regions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>False positives from background text:</strong>
            Introduced strict validation rules and rejection logic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Frame drops and latency:</strong>
            Limited processing to only required regions instead of full-frame OCR.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Unreliable OCR strings:</strong>
            Treated OCR output as an input signal, not as a final truth.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These changes shifted the system from a fragile demo to a predictable,
        production-oriented inspection pipeline.
    </p>

    <!-- ================= PRODUCTION READINESS ================= -->
    <h2>Why This Is Production-Oriented</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Deterministic OK / NG decision logic</li>
        <li>Clear separation between detection and validation</li>
        <li>Continuous operation mindset</li>
        <li>Traceable inspection results</li>
        <li>Designed for integration with PLC or automation controllers</li>
    </ul>
